## Configuring the toolkit

The toolkit requires basic configuration, like user credentials and tenancy OCID. This information can be provided by using a configuration file.

The default path and recommended file name of configuration file for toolkit is ``$HOME/config``.

You can add multiple profiles with different values for these entries in the configuration file, then you can specify which profile to load in the ``Configure`` dialog.

Like some Oracle Cloud Infrastructure SDKs, the toolkit requires a ``DEFAULT`` profile. Add profiles to the configuration file as given in the following example.

```
[DEFAULT]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..<unique_ID>
fingerprint=<your_fingerprint>
key_file=~/.oci/oci_api_key.pem
tenancy=ocid1.tenancy.oc1..<unique_ID>
region=us-ashburn-1

[ADMIN_USER]
user=ocid1.user.oc1..<unique_ID>
fingerprint=<your_fingerprint>
key_file=keys/admin_key.pem
pass_phrase=<your_passphrase>
```

  2. Download ``oci-java-sdk-2.34.0.zip`` from [oci-java-sdk  2.34.0](https://github.com/oracle/oci-java-sdk/releases/tag/v2.34.0) and extract.
  3. Copy ``oci-java-sdk-2/lib/oci-java-sdk-full-2.34.0.jar`` to ``oci-toolkit-intellij/lib/sdk`` folder and copy all the jar files in  ``oci-java-sdk-2/third-party/lib``folder to ``oci-toolkit-intellij/lib/thirdparty`` folder.
